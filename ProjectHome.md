Gpro Viewer is an Android widget for viewing information from the F1 online game http://www.gpro.net, so you can know your current position on the qualification grid or  view the whole grid, or watch the last lap race.

**IMPORTANT**

All of you who downloaded the version from the project's site, please uninstall it before through Settings->Application->Manage application

Also remember that this is a WIDGET, not an application so it isn't showed along your other apps, you have to install it on your desktop as a widget.
